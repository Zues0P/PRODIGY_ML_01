Implementing a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms and more features.

Using Advanced regression methods ,i have made a model which is capable of predicting the price of the house.

I have used the data set : https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

I have made 2 Jupyter notebooks ,  the first deals with the test data and other with the train data and has the rest of the code too.
Deals with test and train data mean that the notebooks consist the code which deal with missing values in the data. 

I have used the elbow method to determine the value of clusters to be used in the model for clustering.
